            <h2>Discovery helps systems adapt to their environments.</h2>
            <p>Wiggling toward bio-inspired machine intelligence. Inspired by jellyfish and octopuses, Juncal Arbelaiz investigates theoretical underpinnings that will enable systems to more efficiently adapt to their environments. She uses system-theoretic approaches to design novel optimal controllers and estimators for systems with spatiotemporal dynamics.</p>

            <h2>New book discusses the findings of COVID</h2>
            <p>Breathless book explores COVID-19s origins and other pandemic science. The book is a portrait of the virus — SARS-CoV-2s early days in China, how decades of science helped researchers craft effective vaccines within a year, the arrival of highly mutated variants. It is not about the societal upheaval or the public health failures  </p>
